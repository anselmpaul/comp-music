# Computational Musicology 

This repo contains my personal portfolio for the class computational musicology.

## The Corpus

The corpus is the dataset of music I will analyze over the coming weeks. I decided to analyse my top songs of the past years, which spotify yearly curates every year for its "Wrapped 20XX" feature. On top of these "top of the year" playlists, I decided to include the "My Time Capsule" playlist. This playlist is generated by spotify based on your taste in music and is supposed to result in a personal throwback mix. Therefore my corpus consists of:

- [YourTopSongs2021](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1EUMDoJuT8yJsl?si=bef5daf5d77b45a3)
- [YourTopSongs2020](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1EM7qCiGJ1Gn8k?si=247fe0f2c649452b)
- [YourTopSongs2019](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1Et9WvpWFqmxbY?si=ddefdf9649cb4755)
- [YourTopSongs2018](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1EjhqquC42OsiQ?si=2cb2d1db75e84e15)
- [YourTopSongs2017](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1E9TS01BSKMXEH?si=d9d7fe4bb01c4623)
- [YourTopSongs2016](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1Cz4Gm1cXBGwvS?si=9abedc3d5453451b)
- [YourTimeCapsule](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1EuAnClVhLBJo6?si=8760d1d6a4ec4f1e)

## Motivation
This dataset consists of 650 songs over a span of six years. I'm interested if and how my taste and music has changed, if there are trends which could correlate with events in my life, and if I can uncover the recipe for the "Time Capsule" Playlist. How does the distribution between genres shift? Are there artists that stay consistently throughout the years, are there "rising stars"?

A strength of this dataset is that it should be expressive - I can't find the exact number right now, but as far as I remember my "minutes of listening" per year are around 50.000 minutes/year. A weakness (or maybe visible trend?) could be that over the past two years I've shifted away from listening on Spotify exclusively to using SoundCloud specifically for listening to Techno & House.

As (a-)typical songs I have selected the first and last song of the six yearly playlists:
